# RPi-CPU-Temperature-Controlled-Fan-Speed
Raspberry pi 3 CPU temperature controlled fan speed</br >
tested on strecth, jessie and ubuntu mate 16.04.2 with 5V and 12V external PSU</br >
Warning do NOT connect a fan, motor, coil or relay without a back EMF protection diode to your pi</br >
pwnfan-0.01.0.py uses PWMLED function (pulse width modulation) a transistor, a resistor and diode to control fan</br >
min = on temperature, coff = off temprature min - coff, dcmin = minimum dutycycle fan will run at, max = temperature for 100% fan  </br > 
Pins BCM22(pin15) also tested on BCM17(pin11)</br >
python3 /home/pi/workspace/FanSpeed/pwmfan-0.1.0.py</br ></br >
fan.sh is only required for run at boot, commands /etc/init.d/fan.sh start /etc/init.d/fan.sh stop, this file is placed in /etc/init.d owner root:root exacutable and set it to run at boot, edit the paths in fans.sh for your location of pwmfan.0.1.0.py</br >
</br >
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/fan.sh</br >
sudo chown root:root /etc/init.d/fan.sh</br >
sudo update-rc.d fan.sh defaults</br ></br >
If you want to stop running at boot</br > 
sudo update-rc.d -f fan.sh remove </br >

<pre>
Test set up
RPi 3 B in a case with cpu heatsink and 30mm fan at room teperature of 22째 C
Test starts with cpu at idle and fan off, cpu about 47째 C
Cooling start set at 42째 C and 30% dutycycle (minimum fan start dutycycle)
there are two periods or 100% cpu usage cpu reaches about 53째 C
